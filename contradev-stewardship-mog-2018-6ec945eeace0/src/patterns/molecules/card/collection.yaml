  Cards are out way of presenting information and teasers to the user.  They will typically be used on the dashboard to promote 
  a particular appeal, or outline some information the user needs to act on (like link bank account).  They can also be used at the end
  of a process to encourage the user to do something else.  For example at the end of the linking a bank account the user could be presented
  with a card encouraging them to give.
